# Clock App

This Flutter application provides a feature-rich clock experience, offering digital and analog clock displays, customizable watch straps, a timer function, and an engaging splash screen on startup.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: A visually appealing splash screen to welcome users as the app initializes.
- **Digital Clock**: A precise and easy-to-read digital clock display.
- **Analog Clock**: A classic analog clock with smooth animations.
- **Strap Customization**: A unique feature allowing users to customize the appearance of their clock with different straps.
- **Timer**: A simple and user-friendly timer functionality.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clock_app.git
    cd clock_app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

### Splash Screen
The splash screen appears briefly when the app is launched. It is implemented using Flutter's `SplashScreen` widget.

### Digital Clock
The digital clock screen displays the current time in a digital format. It uses `DateTime.now()` to update the time every second.

### Analog Clock
The analog clock screen provides a traditional clock interface with animated clock hands. It is built using `CustomPaint` and `TweenAnimationBuilder` for smooth animations.

### Strap Customization
Users can customize the look of their clock by selecting different watch straps from a variety of styles. The selected strap is applied dynamically to both digital and analog clocks.

### Timer
The timer feature allows users to set a countdown timer. It includes start, pause, and reset functionalities. The timer screen displays the remaining time in a digital format.
